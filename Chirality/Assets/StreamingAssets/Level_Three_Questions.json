This is known as the morphine rule.","Morphine is commercially available in a variety of products as the free base monohydrate and as hydrochloride, sulphate, tartrate, and other salts.","Investigators learned about morphine’s mode of action by applying it and other opiates to guinea-pig intestines (a case of nominative determinism perhaps).","In the late 1800s, hoping to come up with a non-addictive painkiller, the Bayerchemical company tried to acetylate both of morphine’s hydroxyl groups (in a similar way to how salicylic acid was converted into aspirin). Sadly, they invented heroin in the process.","Early attempts to unlock the mysteries of opium and morphine provided a major stimulus for the development of organic chemistry."]},

It can be formed endogenously in mammals through fatty acid oxidation via decarboxylation of larger ketone bodies.","Acetone is a colourless, volatile, flammable liquid, and is the simplest ketone.","Acetone was the name of an American alternative rock band formed in 1992 in Los Angeles, California. They toured with British band 'The Verve' for a while.","Most acetone is made during the production of phenol.  Phenol is mostly used to make polymers like plastics; it was also the first antiseptic to be discovered.","Acetone is a very popular and versatile chemical than often goes “missing” in organic chemistry labs. Some people get round this by relabeling the bottles as dimethyl ketone, 2-propanone, or beta-ketopropane.","The German chemist August Kekulé published the modern structural formula for acetone in 1865.","Acetone is used as a polar, aprotic solvent in a variety of organic reactions, such as SN2 reactions.","Acetone is a common building block in organic chemistry and is also well used by organic chemists for cleaning glassware."]},

The addition of sodium nitroprusside to diluted Coniine forms a complex that gives a red colour to the solution.
